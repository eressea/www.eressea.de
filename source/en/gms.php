<h3>Running your own game</h3>

<p>If you are feeling especially ambitious, and want to start your own game with friends just like we did 20 years ago, that's also an option! Eressea's game server is an open source project, which means that anyone can grab the source from our <a href="https://github.com/eressea/server">github repository</a> and compile it themselves. This is not for the faint of heart, and some experience with the C programming language might be required. We're always interested in spreading the love, though, so if you get stuck, please send an email and we'll help you get going. You'll be glad to hear that unlike the game rules, most of the source code and it's documentation is in English.</p>
