    <h3>Eressea - Germany's most popular PBEM now speaks
    English</h3>
    <p>Eressea is a turn-based strategy game in a fantasy
    setting. It is an open-ended game, adding new players to
    the fringes of the world all the time. The game is free of
    charge, has around 1700 players and is growing rapidly even
    after more than six years.</p>
    <p>The original game was written for a German speaking
    audience, and there is plenty of German material available
    on the web. Since early 2002 we're accepting
    English-speaking players as well, after having done a
    massive amount of localization.

    <h3>Registration</h3>
    <p>Chances are you've never played Eressea before, and need
    to learn the basics of the game first, we've got a tutorial
    game that lets you do just that. The registration pages let
    you sign up for a game, and depending on whether you're a
    returning player or a new recruit, signs you up for either
    game.

    pages</a></div>
    <h3>Rules and Downloads</h3>
    <p>Compared to other games, Eressea is fairly complex, and
    has a pretty big manual. Unlike other games, you'll really
    have to read this manual before you start playing. The
    rules are avaliable online, and so are a number of tools
    that simplify playing, most notably Magellan, a graphical
    client for the game.

    <h3>Questions?</h3>
    <p>You probably have a few. There are different ways to get
    them answered. You can reach us at 
    <a href="mailto:info@eressea.de">info@eressea.de</a>, but
    keep in mind that we're rather busy and providing Eressea
    for free. We have regular jobs that don't leave us time to
    answer even one question per month for each of the 1700
    players - that would be more than 400 a week! Definitely
    the best way to get a quick answer is IRC. There is a
    channel #eressea on IRCnet (irc.stealth.net is a popular
    American server) and the people there are a friendly and
    helpful bunch. As an alternative, there is also a mailing
    list of experienced players answering questions at 
    <a href="mailto:eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de">
    eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de</a>.</p>
